Although the word *Baroque* may sound unfamiliar to people, [**<u>Baroque music</u>**](https://www.baroque.org/baroque/whatis) exists in our daily life from commercials to movies. The elaborate Baroque music features the use of [**<u>counterpoint</u>**](https://www.britannica.com/art/counterpoint-music), which refers to the musical technique of playing two or more independent lines of music simultaneously. Among the talented composers in the Baroque period, **Bach** and **Handel** were the most influential ones. Their works contributed to the establishment of Baroque music, and both of them were praised as the leading composers of the Baroque era. Though they shared similarities in music achievement, they had different experiences throughout their journeys of music.


Families of Bach and Handel held different opinions about music. The two prominent musicians showed their gift in music at a young age. As for **Bach**, being born into a great musical family, he inherited talent from his father, who was the leader of the town musicians. Being exposed to music every day, Bach was destined to be a musician. Besides, he received support from his family on the study of music. **Handel**, though possessed remarkable talent, was forbidden to learn music since his father expected him to be a lawyer. However, Handel didn’t abandon his calling of being a composer. At the age of seven, he finally convinced his father to let him learn music since he inspired Duke Adolf by skilled performance. With persistence and passion for music, Handel successfully became a composer.

To distinguish their masterpieces, audiences should pay attention to the styles of music. The compositions of Bach were solemn and antique, whereas Handel’s music was lively and modern. When it comes to composing, Bach preferred instrumental forms. He was specialized in composing organ pieces and concertos. The [***<u>Brandenburg Concertos</u>***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCPM8DEsvmc) and the [***<u>Goldberg Variations</u>***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah392lnFHxM) were his most renowned works. However, Bach didn’t write any operas. In comparison, Handel focused on vocal forms. [**<u>"Hallelujah"</u>**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI6dsMeABpU) chorus in his oratorio *Messiah* has been a household melody. Bach’s works mainly focused on indoor pieces. By contrast, Handel composed some outdoor festival suites such as [***<u>Water Music</u>***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuw8YjSbKd4) and [***<u>Music for the Royal Fireworks</u>***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7vJ2UFbeXA).

Although both of them were outstanding figures of Baroque music, Bach and Handel didn’t enjoy the same fame at their time. Bach was not widely recognized as a composer until his works were studied after his death. As a restrained musician, Bach stayed in Germany for his whole life. Conversely, Handel traveled everywhere and made acquaintance with other brilliant musicians abroad. The reputation of Handel rose markedly since his work was appreciated by the king. In addition, his operas were highly acclaimed by the audiences. These advantages made Handel a more renowned composer than Bach.

When listening to [**<u>the organ music of Bach</u>**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgDMxs4aHZU), audiences can receive a sense of solemnity. When appreciating [**<u>suites of Handel</u>**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji6Xx24Oc4s), audiences will find the music courtly and gorgeous. Bach, though possessed overall musical technique, couldn’t achieve the fame that Handel owned. Furthermore, Handel lived a more affluent life than Bach, and he was one of a few long-lived musicians. The two significant figures wrote a splendid page of Baroque music jointly. Their compositions also cast a long shadow on the history of classical music. People today can indulge themselves in the Baroque atmosphere by admiring their works. Nowadays, the elaboration of their music is still widely researched, and they will be remembered as the most influential composers in
the Baroque period.
